The Personal Department lists [career ladders and classes](http://per.lacity.org/index.cfm?content=careerladder_cat) on their website. Find a class that meets your interests and background. From there, set an alert on [Government Jobs](https://governmentjobs.com/careers/lacity) for the relevant class for the next opening.

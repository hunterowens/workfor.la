It depends on the position, on the class, how well you score on the exam, etc. It will take months. If you need a job RIGHT NOW, this is not the best route to get one. If youâ€™re interested in potentially changing employers down the road, then you should definitely sign up for a test. Maybe a year? Hopefully less.

Congrats on taking your first _real_ step towards getting an LA City Job! Once you pass an exam, you will receive a score. When a department needs to hire a specific position (for example, Management Assistant), they will request a list from Personnel, and you will get a notification to call the department if youâ€™re interested in applying for that specific job. The list is ranked by score, so the department will typically interview the top 6 (or so) applicants on the list.

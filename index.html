  <h1>It takes a year, but itâ€™s worth a lifetime!</h1>
  <p><a href="./#team">We</a> want you to work for the City of Los Angeles. However, the process involved in getting a City Job can be a bit confusing. This site exists to help explain the process and help make it easier to pursue a public service career.</p>

  <p>Currently, there are three different types of city jobs; <b>Civil Service</b>, <b>Exempt</b>, and <b>Contractor</b>.</p>

  <p><b>Civil Service Jobs</b> (also called "regular" or "non-exempt") are the majority of jobs in the City. To get hired into one of these jobs: Take a test specific to that job, get a score, interview in structured panel interviews. Once you're hired, there's a lot more job security. If you're interested in checking out Regular opportunities, <a href="https://www.governmentjobs.com/careers/lacity">here's the list of current exams that are open.</a></p>

  <p><b>Exempt Jobs</b> are listed at the <a href="http://per.lacity.org/index.cfm?content=exemptjobs">Personnel Department Site</a>. Applying for them is as simple as submitting a resume. Be aware that they are often somewhat political. For example, if you work for a councilmember, when he loses an election, you're probably out of a job. But that wouldn't be the case with a "regular" job.)</p>

  <p><b>Contractor Jobs</b> are for IT Contract Professionals within the City. (Think DevOps, Database Administrator, Data Scientist among a few examples). The Information Technology Agency maintains a contract with <a href="http://ita.lacity.org/about-ita/it-professional-contract-firms">7 Professional Contract Firms</a>. You have to contract them to apply for the jobs that are <i>typically</i> annual contract jobs. However, the process for getting hired as a contractor is much shorter than getting hired as regular/civil service employee.</p>

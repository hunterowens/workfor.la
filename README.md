# WorkFor.LA

The City of Los Angeles faces a retirement crisis. 46% of City workers will be eligible for retirement in the next 2 years.

Applying for civil service jobs (which compose the majority of City workers) is confusing and time-consuming. This project will explain the process to prospective applicants and encourage them to apply.

# What makes it so confusing? 

Briefly, here's the process: 
Applicants apply to take a civil service test for the specific type of position (e.g. accountant). If they're accepted, they take the test. They wait. They interview for this type of position. (Note: They're not interviewing for an actual job, just for this type of position generally.) They get a score. If their score is high enough, they receive emails with job notifications about specific openings. They call the Department to report that they're interested in working there. They interview. And finally, if they interview well, they get a job!

From start to finish, the process takes a year or two. (Yes, you read that correctly.) 

There are a lot more details than what's described above, so the goal of this site is to help prospective applicants at every step of the way.

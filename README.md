## Work for Los Angeles

The City of Los Angeles faces a retirement crisis. 46% of City workers will be eligible for retirement in the next 2 years. 

Part of the challenge is that applying for civil service jobs (which compose the majority of City workers) is confusing and time-consuming. This project aims to explain the process to prospective applicants and encourage them to apply.
